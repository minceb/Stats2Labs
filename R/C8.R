#' Chapter 8 APExams
#'
#' Are high-achieving high school students more inclined to take Advanced Placement exams? In a
#' recent student survey, the co-author of this book asked students in his statistics courses to report the
#' number of Advanced Placement (AP) exams they had taken in high school. In addition, information
#' on their self-reported cumulative high school grade point average (HSGPA) and gender was recorded.
#' Assume that students attended high school for four years.

#' Chapter 8 Gala
#'
#' Data on plant species on the Galápagos islands have been collected more than once. The most recent
#' extensive data were reported by Johnson and Raven. We will consider two response variables: island total
#' observed species count and island endemic species count. There are five potential covariates that we expect
#' to be related to species count: island area (km2
#' ) and elevation (meters), the distance (km) from the island to
#' its nearest neighbor (adjacent island) and to the largest island (km2
#' ) in the archipelago (Santa Cruz), and the
#' area of the adjacent island (km2).

#' Chapter 8 Grandslam
#'
#' The data set Grandslam contains measurements on several commonly recorded
#' statistics (e.g., numbers of grand slams, home runs, and runs batted) for 30 Major League Baseball teams. The
#' values for the variables GrSlam (number of grand slams), Cycles (number of cycles), and Games (number
#' of games) are count totals over five seasons from 2006 to 2010. The values for the remaining variables are
#' averages over the five seasons.

#' Chapter 8 Hurricane
#'
#' With all the discussion about climate change in the past couple of decades, it is no surprise that the
#' occurrence of several intense hurricanes over the past several years has garnered some attention. You
#' may remember that in 2005 the U.S. Gulf coast was hit by hurricanes Emily, Katrina, and Rita. All three
#' were category five on the Saffir-Simpson scale. That is the highest intensity on this five-level scale.
#'
#' The Data set hurricanes contains 59 lines, one for each year from 1950 through 2008. For each
#' year, there are five columns of data containing counts of the number of hurricanes of each category
#' type on the Saffir-Simpson scale (labeled cat1, cat2, cat3, cat4, or cat5). The data were
#' obtained from http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic

#' Chapter 8 Smoking
#'
#' Several regular smokers were selected from a larger Minnesota survey about smoking habits. All reported
#' smoking about the same number of cigarettes per day in recent months.
#' Each was asked to report on the number of cigarettes smoked the day before (January 26) during the same 2-hour period. They were also asked
#' whether they had been at work or at home or elsewhere during that 2-hour period.
