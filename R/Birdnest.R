#' Chapter 1 BirdNest dataset
#'
#'This data set was collected in the spring of 1999 for a class project by Amy Moore, a Grinnell College student.
#'Each record in the data set represents data for a species of North American passerine bird. Passerines are
#'“perching birds” and include many families of familiar small birds (e.g., spar-rows and warblers) as well as some
#'larger species like crows and ravens, but do not include hawks, owls, water fowl, wading birds, and woodpeckers.
#'Moore took all North American passerines for which complete evolutionary data were available, which comprised 99
#'of the 470 species of pas-serines in North America (part of her study used this evolutionary information).
#'One hypothesis of interest was about the relationship of body size to type of nest. Body size was measured as
#'average length of the species, nest type was categorized as either closed or open. Although nests come in a
#'variety of types (see the Nesttype variable), in this data set “closed” refers to nests with only a small
#'opening to the outside, such as the tree-cavity nest of many nuthatches or the pendant-style nest of an oriole.
#'“Open” nests include the cup-shaped nest of the American robin.
