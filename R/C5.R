#' Chapter 5 Memory Data
#'
#' This is the main dataset used in chapter 5. In the memory study, 12 subjects each took 4 tests, providing 48 measurements. This may not appear to be
#' a large enough sample size to simultaneously test the three research questions for this study. Statistics based
#' on larger sample sizes are more reliable and increase the ability to confidently draw conclusions. However,
#' properly designed experiments can be very effective even with small sample sizes, as we will see when we
#' analyze the memory experiment data. Instead of attempting to calculate the sample size needed before a study
#' is conducted, this text focuses on using the model assumptions and analysis (discussed in Chapters 2 and 4)
#' to determine if the study is reliable. See chapter 5 for more info.

#' Chapter 5 Flower Data
#'
#' Students in an introductory statistics class tested the impact of different types of water solutions on the longevity of cut flowers. They purchased 18 white carnations and randomly assigned each flower to one of three
#' treatments (plain water, one aspirin crushed and added to the water, and a floral compound provided by the
#' flower shop) and then measured how many days it took until the flower wilted. See page 151 for more info

#' Chapter 5 Popcorn Data
#'
#' Two students in a design of experiments course wanted to test if the price and the storage location of popcorn
#' influenced the percentage of kernels that popped.* The students purchased three boxes of both an expensive
#' and a generic popcorn brand (labeled Exp and Gen). Each box contained six microwavable bags of popcorn.
#' Two bags were randomly selected from each box and stored for one week, one in the refrigerator (Frig) and
#' the other at room temperature (Room). The bags were popped in random order according to the instructions
#' on the box, and the percentage of popped kernels was calculated for each bag.

#' Chapter 5 Handwash Data
#'
#' With the H1N1 outbreak in 2010, hand washing was well promoted as one of the most effective and
#' economical methods for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. For a final project, two statistics students
#' were interested in comparing the effectiveness of three hand-washing soaps (62% ethyl-alcohol-based hand
#' Sanitizer, 0.15% tricolsan antibacterial soap, and a soap lacking antimicrobial agents).
#' These researchers used sterile swabs to swab each participant’s right hand before washing, first going
#' around the fingers and then making an S-shape on the palm. The right hand was swabbed again after subjects
#' washed their hands with one of the cleansers for 20 seconds and let their hands air dry for 3 minutes.
#' Swabs were then placed into a microfuge tube with 500 mL of saline and swirled for 30 seconds to knock
#' off bacteria. Then the researchers vortexed the microfuge tube for 20 seconds and pipetted 100 mL of bacterial solution onto an L-agar plate. Plates were then put in an incubator at 30°C for 72 hours. Colony-forming
#' units (CFUs) were then counted on each plate.

#' Chapter 5 Music Data
#'
#' Three students in an introductory statistics class read an article suggesting that listening to certain
#' types of music helps doctors perform chest compressions for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It
#' is suggested that optimal CPR performance is 100 beats per minute. Most doctors start out at the right
#' pace but tend to slow down over time. Gore and Lloyd found that doctors performed much better when
#' listening to the song Stayin’ Alive, by the Bee Gees, which has a rhythm of 103 beats per minute.7
#' These students developed a research question asking if music also influences performance in
#' other areas. They designed an experiment testing whether music tempo or length of test (1 minute or                                                                                        3 minutes) influenced students’ ability to type fast and accurately. Would subjects listening to Stayin’ Alive type at a different speed than subjects listening to Yesterday by the Beatles?
#' Forty undergraduate students consented to be in the study. Each subject took four tests from
#' the website typingtest.com in random order based on two coin flips: 1 min/Yesterday, 1 min/Stayin’ Alive, 3 min/Yesterday, and 3 min/Stayin’ Alive. The questions the researcher wanted to test were
#' the effect of Song, Length, and Song*Length on words per minute (WPM)
