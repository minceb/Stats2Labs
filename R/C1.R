#' Chapter 1 Age data
#'
#' This data comes from a lawsuit involving Robert Martin and the company he worked at, Westavco, a paper producer company. He was laid off in Round 2
#' of several layoffs by the company. He sued the company, claiming to be a victim of age discrimination. The ages of the 10 workers
#' involved in Round 2 were: 25, 33, 35, 38, 48, 55, 55, 55, 56, and 64. The ages of the three people laid off were 55, 55, and 64.

#' Chapter 1 BirdNest dataset
#'
#'This data set was collected in the spring of 1999 for a class project by Amy Moore, a Grinnell College student.
#'Each record in the data set represents data for a species of North American passerine bird. Passerines are
#'“perching birds” and include many families of familiar small birds (e.g., spar-rows and warblers) as well as some
#'larger species like crows and ravens, but do not include hawks, owls, water fowl, wading birds, and woodpeckers.
#'Moore took all North American passerines for which complete evolutionary data were available, which comprised 99
#'of the 470 species of passerines in North America (part of her study used this evolutionary information).
#'One hypothesis of interest was about the relationship of body size to type of nest. Body size was measured as
#'average length of the species, nest type was categorized as either closed or open. Although nests come in a
#'variety of types (see the Nesttype variable), in this data set “closed” refers to nests with only a small
#'opening to the outside, such as the tree-cavity nest of many nuthatches or the pendant-style nest of an oriole.
#'“Open” nests include the cup-shaped nest of the American robin. This dataset is used in Chapters 1 and 7.

#' Chapter 1 Mice data
#'
#' This data comes from a study in which the researchers wanted to find out whether K11777 helps stop schistosome worms from growing.
#' In one phase of the study, 10 female laboratory mice and 10 male laboratory mice were deliberately infected with the schistosome parasite.
#' Starting seven days after being infected with schistosomiasis, each mouse was given an injection every day for 28 days. Within each sex,
#' five mice were randomly assigned to a treatment of K11777 and the other five mice formed a control group injected with an equal volume of
#'  plain water. On day 49, the researchers euthanized the mice and measured both the number of eggs and the number of worms in their livers.
#'  Both numbers were expected to be lower in the treatment group if the drug was effective.

#' Chapter 1 Music data
#'
#'
#' Grinnell College students Anne Tillema and Anna Tekippe conducted an experiment to study the effect
#' of music on a person’s level of relaxation. They hypothesized that fast songs would increase pulse
#' rate more than slow songs. The file called Music contains the data from their experiment.They decided to use a person’s
#' pulse rate as an operational definition of the person’s level of relaxation and to compare pulse rates for
#' two selections of music: a fast song and a slow song. For the fast song they chose “Beyond” by Nine Inch Nails,
#' and for the slow song they chose Rachmaninoff’s “Vocalise.” They recruited 28 student subjects for the experiment.
