#' Chapter 10 GradesC10
#'
#' The data set Grades contains total scores for students’ homework, labs, quizzes, projects, and exams. This course had
#' two 1-hour exams and a 3-hour final exam. In addition to a final project worth 20% of the final grade, there
#' was an initial small project worth only 5% of the final grade. The exams were fairly standard statistics exams,
#' but both projects required students to read peer-reviewed research projects, collect their own data, conduct an
#' appropriate statistical analysis, and present their results. While several students in this introductory class had
#' seen a little statistics in previous courses, this was typically the first time students were asked to read journal
#' articles or conduct a realistic research project.
