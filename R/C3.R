#' Chapter 3 MPG Data
#'
#' The MPG data compare the miles per gallon of several cars against the speed the car was going as well
#'as displacement. Displacement is a measure of the volume of all the cylinders within an engine. The
#'larger the displacement, the more quickly fuel can move through an engine, giving the vehicle more
#' power.

#' Chapter 3 Weights Data
#'
#'In the process of studying the effect of sleep on mammals, T. Allison and D. Cicchetti collected the
#'brain weights (in grams) and body weights (in kilograms) of 62 mammals.
#'In the data set, you can see the measurements for these two variables for each of the 62 animals studied.

#' Chapter 3 Arsenic Data
#'
#'
#' Karagas, Morris, Weiss, Spate, Baskett, and Greenberg collected toenail clippings of several individuals along with samples of each person’s regular drinking water.6
#' In this pilot study, the researchers attempted to determine if arsenic concentrations in people’s toenails could be used to determine
#' the level of arsenic in their water. Each of the 21 individuals in this study had a private well. High
#' arsenic concentrations are related to cancer, and several studies have found a positive correlation
#' between arsenic concentrations of drinking water and toenail samples.

#' Chapter 3 AIDS Data
#'
#' The AIDS data set shows the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in adults aged 15 to 49 in least developed

#' Chapter 3 Politics Data
#'
#' Do the population characteristics of each state (e.g., unemployment level, education level, age,
#' income level, religious preferences, health insurance, and voter turnout) influence how people vote?
#' Do these characteristics have an impact on the composition of state legislatures?
#'In 2001, several college students collected data from 50 states on each of these factors from the U.S. Census Bureau.

#' Chapter 3 Caucuses Data
#'

#' The Caucuses data set contains the 2008 Democratic and Republican caucus results. Republicans
#' count actual votes. Democrats don’t record individual votes, but each precinct allocates its delegates
#' based on the number of people in the precinct supporting each candidate during the caucus. Senator
#' Clinton was expected to win in most polls, but ended up a surprising third after Senators Obama and
#' Edwards. Many political analysts have found that females, less educated people, and older people
#' voted for Senator Clinton, while younger people, more educated people, and African Americans preferred Senator Obama.
