#' Chapter 3 MPG Data
#'
#' The MPG data compare the miles per gallon of several cars against the speed the car was going as well
#'as displacement. Displacement is a measure of the volume of all the cylinders within an engine. The
#'larger the displacement, the more quickly fuel can move through an engine, giving the vehicle more
#' power.

#' Chapter 3 Weights Data
#'
#'In the process of studying the effect of sleep on mammals, T. Allison and D. Cicchetti collected the
#'brain weights (in grams) and body weights (in kilograms) of 62 mammals.
#'In the data set, you can
#;see the measurements for these two variables for each of the 62 animals studied.

#' Chapter 3 Arsenic Data
#'
#'
#' Karagas, Morris, Weiss, Spate, Baskett, and Greenberg collected toenail clippings of several individuals along with samples of each person’s regular drinking water.6
#' In this pilot study, the researchers attempted to determine if arsenic concentrations in people’s toenails could be used to determine
#' the level of arsenic in their water. Each of the 21 individuals in this study had a private well. High
#' arsenic concentrations are related to cancer, and several studies have found a positive correlation
#' between arsenic concentrations of drinking water and toenail samples.
