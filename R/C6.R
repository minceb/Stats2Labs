#' Primatologist Vicki Bentley-Condit of Grinnell College studied interactions between female and infant
#' yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus cynocephalus) at the Tana River National Primate Reserve in Kenya.
#' She collected the data for her study by observing baboons in 20-minute focal samples over an 11-month
#' period in 1991–1992. Her subjects included 23 female baboons, 11 of which were mothers with infants (no
#' mother with more than one offspring). Bentley-Condit observed and recorded interactions between females
#' and infants, excluding interactions between a mother and her own offspring.

#' At a summer tea party in the late 1920s, a lady claimed that she could determine by taste if tea had
#' been poured into the milk or if milk had been poured into the tea. Sir Ronald Fisher, well known
#' for his work in design of experiments, discussed how to test this lady’s claim. The lady was asked
#' to taste several cups in random order and identify each as tea first or milk first. Although the actual
#' results were not published, rumor has it that the lady correctly identified every single cup.
#' Let’s assume that the lady was given 14 cups of tea in random order. She was told that half the
#' cups had tea first and the other half had milk first. Table 6.10 provides hypothetical results.

#' Many people with cocaine addictions also suffer from mood disorders like depression or a manic-depressive disorder.
#' To aid in the process of trying to break a patient’s addiction to cocaine, a
#' common antidepressant known as lithium is often given to patients in drug treatment centers. A
#' randomized, comparative experiment was performed to determine whether another commonly
#' prescribed antidepressant, disipramine, could be used to reduce the likelihood of patients’ using
#' cocaine again or whether antidepressant therapy helped at all. The 72 patients selected for study
#' over a 3-year period were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: disipramine, lithium, or
#' a placebo. After the end of the 6-week treatment period, these patients were interviewed to determine if they
#' had been successful in stopping their cocaine habit. A success was defined as having
#' stopped using cocaine for 3 weeks or more during the 6-week treatment period. The data from the
#' study are shown in Table 6.12.

#' A local organization conducted a traffic study to determine if traffic collisions were more likely on
#' Friday and Saturday nights than on other nights. The city council was considering a proposal that
#' bars in a specific district be closed earlier in an effort to reduce late-night accidents in the area. The
#' assumption was that a larger number of traffic accidents would correspond to the heaviest bar traffic
#' (which occurred on the weekends). Table 6.13 shows data collected on traffic accidents that had
#' occurred in that district over the past two years.

#' In October 1995, the United Kingdom Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) issued a warning
#' to 190,000 general practitioners, pharmacists, and directors of public health about oral contraceptive
#' pills containing gestodene or desogestrel. The warning, based on three unpublished epidemiological
#' research studies, stated, “It is well known that the pill may rarely produce thrombosis (blood clots)
#' involving veins of the legs. New evidence has become available indicating that the chance of thrombosis
#' occurring in a vein increases about two-fold for some types of pills compared to others.
