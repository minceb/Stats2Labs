\description{
The data appear in Table 8.1. The four age groups are the groups reported in the CTR. Day and
colleagues provided the Randolph data by age group after carefully checking each reported case through inperson
interviews (they found only 49 valid cases of adult cancers, rather than the 67 cases originally reported
by the neighborhood). Here, we extract the number of cases for each age group for the years 1980â€“1984 for
Connecticut using the reported rates and population data.
