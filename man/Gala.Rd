\description{
Data on plant species on the Gal√°pagos islands have been collected more than once. The most recent
extensive data were reported by Johnson and Raven. We will consider two response variables: island total
observed species count and island endemic species count. There are five potential covariates that we expect
to be related to species count: island area (km2
) and elevation (meters), the distance (km) from the island to
its nearest neighbor (adjacent island) and to the largest island (km2
) in the archipelago (Santa Cruz), and the
area of the adjacent island (km2).
